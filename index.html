        93 million miles from our very homes, right in the middle of our solar system, is the sun – our very own star
        that brings us light and life. The sun affects weather here on Earth and determines whether our days will be
        filled with light and warmth, but it also affects the weather up above in space.

        Weather in space isn’t made up of clouds, snow or rain. Instead, it is determined by the sun and the small
        particles it scatters towards Earth and the other planets in our solar system. We call this phenomenon solar
        wind.

        It was just another day at the NASA headquarters when scientists slowly noticed that their radios weren’t
        working. They all scratched their heads in frustration wondering why they couldn’t listen to their favorite
        songs or hear their favorite news anchors. “Oh!” one shouted, “It must be a radio blackout storm!” These storms
        occur when explosions on the sun's surface cause particles to shoot through our Earth’s atmosphere, disturbing
        our radios here on Earth and preventing us from communicating with each other or listening to our favorite
        songs. This can be especially dangerous during emergency situations when we require radios to communicate
        important information. Fed up with the situation, the scientists decided they needed to do some work prompting
        them to build Little Parker, a solar probe that they’d launch up into space in hopes that he would someday touch
        the sun.
